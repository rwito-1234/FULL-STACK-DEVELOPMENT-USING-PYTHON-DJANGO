       <h1> Patrick Young </h1>
       <p> I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a
         programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
         designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
         Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product conception through the actual product
         launch.
