          <h3>My Trip To California </h3>
          <p> It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for 
              the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.
              By the time we returned home, we had travelled some 1,300 miles in three and one half
              days.

          <h3>My Trip To The Rockies </h3>
          <p> After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew
              to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy, Pike's Peak,Garden Of The Gods, 
              and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in 
              Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded 
              Amtrack's and and rode the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

          <h3>My Trip To The Mid West </h3>
          <p> My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in
              Indiana where he attends college.In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois, and 
              Detroit,Michigan. We then boarded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City,
              where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
